Yet I can say that almost all of the abstraction layers present at the repositroy together with most of the infastructure part for the web server is written and designed by me.
Only the login system has been developed together with another group member. 
Rest of the group members helped us with finishing all of the pages with their best effort to follow our infastructure.  

## Summary

This is a car rental system designed and imlemented for a database systems course taken the university.
It is using Thymeleaf as its templating engine and levreges Spring Frameworks MVC model and Spring's JDBC together with a custom abstraction layer written in between. (Almost everything about the abstractin is under the logic folder inside the source code.) While designing and implementing this project I once again noticed the challanges no javascript brings with the design of the server. And I enjoyed to learn a different perspective which Thymeleaf together with Spring tries to bring into the picture.
